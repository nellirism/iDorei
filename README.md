## Description

The iDorei Work Day application is designed to help you to set your work momentum for the day. It is a responsive app that allows for entering a descriptive task on each hour of your work day. Once you enter a task, it also allows you to add the task into your browser's local storage.  The task areas are designed to disable if the hour is in the past. It is also color-coded to indicate the past, present and future hour.
